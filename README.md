# ðŸš— CTrail: Trust-Aware MCTS for Cooperative Trajectory Planning

CTrail is a **trust-aware, graph-based planning framework** combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-guided scene reasoning. It is designed for complex autonomous driving scenarios involving multi-agent interaction, trust modeling, and language-guided graph construction.

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

Trajectory planning in dynamic environments is a paramount challenge for autonomous driving, especially in unseen environments where traditional models struggle to generalize. To address this, we propose \textsf{C-TRAIL}, a \textbf{\underline{C}}ommonsense world framework for \textbf{\underline{TRA}}jectory p\textbf{\underline{L}}anning. Inspired by how humans leverage commonsense when planning, C-TRAIL introduces a \textbf{Commonsense World} that interacts with the environment through a closed-loop three-stage process: \textbf{Recall}, \textbf{Plan}, and \textbf{Update}.



This commonsense world is implemented via three core modules. First, \textbf{Trust Commonsense Recall} module queries LLMs for high-level relations and actions, and filters through a fused trust mechanism combining commonsense trust and kinematic trust, resulting in a trust commonsense representation. Second, the \textbf{Commonsense-Guided Monte Carlo Planning} module integrates this representation into a Dirichlet-based trust policy, which guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for efficient and targeted trajectory exploration. Third, an \textbf{Adaptive Calibration Update} module continuously refines the trust state and planning policy using real-world feedback, ensuring consistency and adaptability over time.

To the best of our knowledge, C-TRAIL is the first to introduce a human-inspired Commonsense World into a trajectory planning loop. Experiments on the Highway-env simulator in four scenarios (i.e., \emph{highway}, \emph{merge}, \emph{intersection}, and \emph{roundabout}) show that Câ€‘TRAIL yields average improvements over state-of-the-art baselines by 53.8\% w.r.t. ADE, 62.5\% w.r.t. FDE, and 35.8\% w.r.t. SR in seen environments, and 42.5\% w.r.t. ADE, 52.2\% w.r.t. FDE, and 27.1\% w.r.t. SR in unseen environments, respectively. Additionally, case studies show that C-TRAIL generates safe and smooth trajectories, underscoring its effectiveness and real-world potential.
